## 🧩 OOP Concepts Used

### 1. Encapsulation
All pizza properties (price, cheese, toppings) are private, and accessed through methods.

### 2. Inheritance
Different types of pizzas extend a common `Pizza` class.

### 3. Polymorphism
`DeluxePizza` overrides the `generateBill()` method.

### 4. Abstraction
The parent class hides the common logic of pizza pricing from the user.
